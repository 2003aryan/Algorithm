Algorithm:-

1.	Begin
2.	Initialized class member – int array_length ,arr[],final_arr[]
3.	Accept an array from the user and each element of the array should not be greater than 50
4.	Sort the array in ascending order using bubble sort or selection sort here we have used bubble sort
5.	//we will put the elements at there required position.
6.	Declare int pos , right=1 ,left=1 
7.	Pos =(if array_length is divisible by 2 then (array_length/2-1) otherwise array_length/2)
8.	Final_array[pos]=arr[0];
9.	A for loop which will have “t=0” as a loop controller which will run till (t<array_length-1) with the 
    increment of t by 1 after every loop. And will repeat line no. 10 to 15
10.	If t is no divisible by 2 then excute step 11 to 12
11.	Set Final_arr[pos+right]=arr[t]
12.	Set r++
13.	Otherwise execute 14 and 15
14.	Set final_arr[pos-left]=arr[t]
15.	Set left++
16.	Now print the array after the above required insertion
17. End
