Algoritm 14:-

1.	Start
2.	Initialize class member 3,4,5,6
3.	Declare int number
4.	Declare boolean flag
5.	Declare int distance_after;
6.	Declare int distance_before
7.	accept a number from the user and store it in “int number”
8.	Set flag=false
9.	distance_after=to find a twin prime present after the specified number 
10.	distance_before=to find a twin prime present before the specified number
11.	to find the whether a number is twin no. or not-
12.	check whether the no itself is a twin prime or no and then check for the specified (number-2 ) if it is then you have the twin prime numbers
13.	to check whether the number is prime –
14.	A for loop which have “i=2” as loop control and will run the loop till i is less than n/2 and with the increment of +1 after every loop and will repeat step 15
15.	If n is divisible by a number then it is not a prime number else it is a prime number
16. Print the result
17.	End
